Generate a list of ${amount} questions about "${topic}".
- Each question should have 3 options.
- Correct option should be in the list of options.
- There can only be 1 (ONE) correct option.
- The correct option should be the first element in the list.
- The questions should be fun and interesting - for trivia or quiz games.
- The questions should be in ${lang}.
- Options should be in ${lang}.
- Options should be in the format: ["option1", "option2", "option3"]
- Options should be short: 6 words max.

${
  history.length > 0
    ? `
--------------
Please avoid asking the following questions:
${history.map((q, i) => `${i + 1}. ${q}\n`)}

And avoid permutations in this question list - Like I don't want shit to be:
- Question to avoid: What's the longest river in the World?
- And you say: What's the worlds largest river?

Thanks.
